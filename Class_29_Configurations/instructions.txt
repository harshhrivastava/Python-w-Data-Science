We will be starting now with data mining and database.
You have to create a folder named "Data Mining and Database" in the base folder,
and a file named "requirements.txt" in the "Data Mining and Database" folder.
After creating the file, you need to run the following command:
    $ conda activate base
    $ pip install -r "Data Mining and Database/requirements.txt"
