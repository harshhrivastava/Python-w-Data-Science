Now you need to create a new folder separately.
This is done because you have to initialize git again.
We will be using a new library today, StreamLit.
This library is similar to matplotlib and seaborn as it is used for visualization.
We will be creating a web app using this which will be displaying charts.
The charts will use a dataset from kaggle and display it.
