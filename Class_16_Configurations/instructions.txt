After 15th Class, you have to create a folder named "Data Analytics" in the base folder,
and a file named "requirements.txt" in the "Data Analytics" folder.
After creating the file, you need to run the following command:
    $ conda activate base
    $ pip install -r "Data Analytics/requirements.txt"
This will install all the required python libraries
which will be required to learn data analytics.
